# Spatial registration

## Introduction

Spatial registration methods use gene expression profiles for cell populations of interest from single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference, and use these single-cell expression profiles to 'spatially register' the spatial coordinates of observations corresponding to these cell populations in spatial transcriptomics data.
