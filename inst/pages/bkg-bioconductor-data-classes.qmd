# Bioconductor data classes {#sec-bkg-bioconductor-data-classes}

## Introduction

Bioconductor provides several data classes for storing and manipulating spatial transcriptomics datasets. By relying on these consistent data structures, we can easily connect methods and packages developed by different research groups to build analysis workflows that include the latest state-of-the-art methods.

Below, we describe the Bioconductor data classes used in this book.


## SpatialExperiment

The [SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SpatialExperiment) class [@Righelli2022] is the core data class used in this book. This class allows us to store datasets at the spot or cell level, i.e. data from sequencing-based platforms at the spot level, or data from imaging-based platforms aggregated to the cell level.

SpatialExperiment builds on the [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment) class [@Amezquita2020] for single-cell RNA sequencing data, with additional customizations to store spatial information, such as spatial coordinates and image files.

A summary of the `SpatialExperiment` object structure is shown in the following schematic. Briefly, a `SpatialExperiment` object consists of (i) `assays` containing expression counts, (ii) `rowData` containing information on features, i.e. genes, (iii) `colData` containing information on spots or cells, including nonspatial and spatial metadata, (iv) `spatialCoords` containing spatial coordinates, and (v) `imgData` containing image data. For spot-based data, a single `assay` named `counts` is used.

For more details, see the `SpatialExperiment` package [Bioconductor vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SpatialExperiment/inst/doc/SpatialExperiment.html) or the paper describing the class [@Righelli2022].

## Imaging-based data

Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics datasets may contain additional information, including the spatial coordinates of individual mRNA molecules, and segmentation boundaries for cells or nuclei.

The following Bioconductor classes provide additional functionality to store and manipulate this information.

These classes extend `SpatialExperiment` and are compatible with `SpatialExperiment` for analyses at the aggregated cell level.


### SpatialFeatureExperiment

`SpatialFeatureExperiment` is available as a [Bioconductor package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SpatialFeatureExperiment) and described by the authors in their paper [@Moses2023].


### MoleculeExperiment

`MoleculeExperiment` is available as a [Bioconductor package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MoleculeExperiment) and described by the authors in their paper [@PetersCouto2023].
