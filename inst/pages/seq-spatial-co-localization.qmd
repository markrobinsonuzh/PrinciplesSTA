# Spatial co-localization {#sec-seq-spatial-co-localization}

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will show examples of analyses to investigate spatial co-localization of cell types.

For these analyses, we will use a different dataset that provides single-cell spatial resolution, e.g. from the 10x Genomics Xenium platform.


## Load previously saved data

We start by loading the previously saved data object(s) (see @sec-seq-clustering-save-objects).

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(SpatialExperiment)
spe <- readRDS("seq-spe_clustering.rds")
```


## Spatial co-localization of cell types

Methods available from Bioconductor for this type of analysis include:
