# Spatial co-localization {#sec-seq-spatial-co-localization}


## Overview

In this chapter, we will show examples of analyses to investigate spatial co-localization of cell types.

For these analyses, we will use a different dataset that provides single-cell spatial resolution, e.g. from the 10x Genomics Xenium platform.


## Load data from previous steps

We start by loading the data object(s) saved after running the analysis steps from the previous chapters. Code to re-run the previous steps is shown in condensed form in @sec-seq-analysis-steps.

## Spatial co-localization of cell types within a single sample

We will use the [spicyR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/spicyR) Bioconductor package [@Canete2022] for the following examples.
