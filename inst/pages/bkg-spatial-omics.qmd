# Spatial omics {#sec-bkg-spatial-omics}

## Introduction

Spatial omics (or spatially-resolved omics) data refers to a set of recently-developed technologies that enable molecular measurements with spatial resolution. Spatial transcriptomics was named the **Method of the Year 2020** [@method-of-year-2020] and spatial proteomics was highlighted as **Method of the Year 2024** @method-of-year-2024 by the journal *Nature Methods*, and each has become widely applied in a range of biological contexts. In general, there are now a wide variety of modalities that can be measured (e.g., antibody-based protein expression, gene expression, chromatin accessibility, histone modificatons), with diverse measurement streams (e.g., imaging, mass spectrometry, high-throughput sequencing), all of which give molecular measurements in a spatial context for a given appropriately-handled segment of tissue.

Platforms differ drasticallly in terms of the experimental procedures used (sequence or ion counts versus fluorescence intensities), the feature space (10s of proteins in imaging mass cytometry to full transcriptome in Visium / Visium HD to genome wide assessments of chromatin accessibility), and spatial resolution (e.g., single-cell resolution or multiple cells per measurement location). In general, that also means there are tradeoffs between the number of features, spatial resolution, and sensitivity of the assays. For our purposes here,

Platforms may be broadly grouped into "sequencing-based" and "imaging-based" technologies; some of the latter can be further classified into "molecule-based" or not; the main platforms are described in more detail below. Sequencing-based platforms tend to provide higher gene coverage (e.g., full-transcriptome), while imaging-based platforms tend to provide higher spatial resolution (e.g., single-cell or even subcellular resolution).

In this book, we focus on commercially available platforms, since these are the most widely used and accessible, but the data representations are often similar for other related platforms. The main sections of the book are split into two parts for sequencing-based and imaging-based platforms, since several of the analysis techniques are specific to these types of data.

In the subsections below, we give a brief overview of some commercially available platforms. For more in-depth background, several recent reviews are available [@Bressan2023; @Moses2022; @Tian2022; @Lundberg2019; @Gulati2024; @Paul2021; @Mund2022; @Palla2022; @Moffitt2022; @Rao2021; @Cheng2023], covering available platforms, analysis methods, outstanding challenges, and additional topics.


## Sequencing-based platforms

Sequencing-based platforms capture DNA fragments (which could represent gene expression, DNA binding, antibody-conjugated tags, etc.) at a set of spatial measurement locations for a tissue section placed on a slide. The spatial location is tagged via a unique barcode for each measurement location, and reads are perhaps summarized (e.g., counts) according to genes or bins.

The advantage of sequencing is that typically the features represent an untargeted set of molecular entities, thus not requiring panel selection and optimization. In reality, some spatial assays still require panels (e.g., spatial variants of CITE-seq; [@Liu2023]) and assays, such as Visium and Visium HD, use genome-wide gene capture panels, and thus cannot always be applied to non-model organisms. Spatial resolution varies between platforms, and depends on the size and spacing between the spatial measurement locations. Depending on the spatial resolution and tissue cell density in a given biological samples, each spatial measurement location may contain zero, one, or multiple cells.
Depending on the platform, the spatial measurement locations are often referred to as "spots" or "beads". In this book, we will generally use the terminology "spots".


### 10x Genomics Visium

The [10x Genomics Visium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression) platform measures transcriptome-scale gene expression at a hexagonal grid of spatial locations (referred to as spots) on a tissue capture area on a slide. Either fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue may be used. Each spot contains millions of spatially-barcoded capture oligonucleotides, which bind to mRNAs from the tissue. A cDNA library is then generated for sequencing, which includes the spatial barcodes, allowing reads to be mapped back to their spatial locations.

The array dimensions are 6.5 x 6.5 mm, with around 5000 barcoded spots. Spots are 55 µm in diameter and spaced 100 µm center-to-center in a hexagonal grid arrangement. The number of cells overlapping with each spot depends on the tissue cell density, e.g. around 0-10 for human brain tissue or ~50 for mouse brain tissue. Each Visium slide contains four tissue capture areas. The following figure provides an illustration.

Histology images generated from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining can be used to identify anatomical and cell morphological features for each sample, including the number of cells per spot.

An earlier version of the platform was developed by @Stahl2016, which was subsequently improved and commercialized as the 10x Genomics Visium platform.

### 10x Genomics Visium HD

The [10x Genomics Visium HD](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/visium-hd-spatial-gene-expression) platform provides higher spatial resolution. Capture area dimensions are 6.5 x 6.5 mm, with a continuous "lawn" of capture oligonucleotides arranged into a grid of 2 x 2 µm barcoded squares, which can be aggregated into 8 x 8 µm and 16 x 16 µm bins for downstream analyses. There are no gaps between the grid squares, and there are two capture areas per slide. The high spatial resolution of the barcoded squares provide near-single-cell resolution, while the use of sequencing provides transcriptome-scale gene coverage.

A preprint describing the platform and its application to human colorectal cancer samples is available from 10x Genomics [@Oliveira2024].

### Curio Seeker

The [Curio Seeker](https://curiobioscience.com/product/) platform is a commercially available implementation and extension of the Slide-seqV2 platform originally developed by @Stickels2021.

The Curio Seeker platform captures mRNA molecules at a set of randomly placed spatial measurement locations (referred to as "beads") on a tissue slide (referred to as a "tile") at high spatial resolution. The tile dimensions are 3 mm x 3 mm, and the spatial resolution consists of tightly packed 10 µm diameter beads.


## Imaging-based transcriptomics platforms

Imaging-based platforms (also referred to as molecule-based platforms) identify the spatial locations of individual RNA molecules by sequential in situ hybridization (ISH) or in situ sequencing (ISS), for targeted panels of up to hundreds or thousands of genes. Since transcripts are individually identified, datasets arrive at sub-cellular spatial resolution.

Image segmentation is used to identify the boundaries of individual cells or nuclei, and assign RNA molecules to cells or nuclei during preprocessing. Segmentation into cells is challenging, especially due to overlapping cells (i.e., cells have 3-dimensional organization and the plane that a tissue slice represents may have material from multiple cells at a given x/y location). After segmentation, gene counts can be aggregated to the cell-level, or analyses may be performed directly at the molecule level. Cell-level analyses may re-use methods developed for spot-level spatial transcriptomics data or single-cell data.

The selection of targeted sets of biologically informative genes for an experiment, referred to as panel design, is a key consideration during experimental design [@Baran2023, @Kuemmerle2024, @Zhang2024-panel]. Several commercially available options for targeted gene sets suitable for certain biological contexts are available.

### 10x Genomics Xenium

Details on the 10x Genomics Xenium platform are available from [10x Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/xenium). Xenium gives an imageable area of 12mm x 24 mm, although slightly less to avoid fiducial markers. Several pre-designed panels are available, including a "Pan Tissue and Pathways" for both mouse and human, which both include over 5000 genes and there is a possibility to custom design an additional 100 genes. More focused panels are available for human brain, lung, colon and breast tissue as well as cancer immunological subpopulations; for mouse, focused brain and multi-tissue panels are available.


### Vizgen MERSCOPE

The [Vizgen MERSCOPE platform](https://vizgen.com/products/), among the fluorescence-based targeted spatial transcriptomics platforms, allows the highest resolution (≤20 nm), while also providing a high capacity for multiplexing, with (customizable) panels containing up to 1000 genes, and an imageable area of 1 cm^2^. MERSCOPE was recently shown to be amongst the most sensitive in a recent head-to-head comparison [@Hartman2024] using mouse brain tissue.

### NanoString CosMx

The [NanoString CosMx platform](https://nanostring.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/) gives an imageable area of 15x20 mm and allows up to 6000 RNAs (and now up to 68 proteins) to be assayed in a spatial context. Their human "discovery" 6000 gene panel is currently being expanded to the full-transcriptome (>18,000 targets), which should become available in 2025. Other more targeted panels are available, including a 1000-gene "Universal Cell Characterization", a focused 100-gene immuno-oncology panel or a 1000-gene mouse neuroscience panel. In addition, custom panels are available in either an add-on (up to 50 genes) or standalone (up to 300 genes) format. (Antibody-based) Protein panels are currently available for human immuno-oncology and mouse neuroscience contexts.

## Imaging-based proteomics platforms

Imaging-based proteomics, or more commonly called multiplexed imaging, represent a broad array of detection technologies, the vast majority of which are antibody-based. [@Semba2024] categorizes these antibody-based technologies into either "single-shot" (e.g., imaging mass cytometry, IMC) or "multicycle" (e.g., Lunaphore) imaging approaches. Single-shot refers to the set of, for example, heavy metal ions (representation protein presence), resulting from a laser ablation of an pre-stained sample. Multi-cycle approaches refer to sets of antibodies that are sequentially stained and stripped, with an imaging step in between at each cycle.

### IMC, MIBIscope, and Phenocycler

Although technology variants are available, we mention a few specific approaches here. The two dominant single-shot spatial proteomics platforms are IMC and MIBIscope, with maximum pixel (or shot) resolution of 0.4 µm and 1 µm, respectively [@Semba2024]. Each platform can measure upwards of 40 channels (proteins).


## Other variations on spatial omics data

Although the focus of the data analyses in this book will be primarily on gene and protein expression measurements in a spatial context, it is worth mentioning other modalities or data structures that are adjacent or emerging. We will not directly have data examples in the book, but some of the steps discussed in the chapters here may have applications to these other contexts.

Tissues are three-dimensional entities that are represented as 2D slices for many of the analyses conducted here. However, there will be various emerging datasets that have measurements made along a third dimension [@Schott2024, @Vickovic2022], whether it's directly measured (e.g., 3D imaging) or indirectly reconstructed from multiple per-slice measurements [@Schott2025]. In some cases, the analyses from this book with either still apply, or be applied successively on multiple slices.

Multi-omics datasets (e.g., RNA expression + protein expression, RNA expression + chomatin accessibility) that are collected in a spatial context are now emerging (e.g., [@Liu2023; @Zhang2023]). Epigenomic modalities, in particular, may require alternative preprocessing steps, but some of the analyses mentioned in the chapters here  could be reused (e.g., clustering given a low-dimensional embedding) or adapted.

Another emerging modality within a spatial context is the measurement of metabolites, lipids or proteins via mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), such as MALDI-MSI [@Zhang2024-msi]; these assays are sometimes known as imaging mass spectrometry. MSI typically involves coating tissues with a matrix layer that promotes the ionization of analytes of interest (e.g., glycans; [@Palomino2024]). Integration of MSI with other spatial modalities (e.g., to reveal cell types)  may be required.
