# Introduction

Imaging-based ST assays have gone from resolving 100s to 1000s of features.
Their commercialization by Vizgen, NanoString, and 10x Genomics has made these data increasingly popular. 
In general, imaging-based ST platforms rely on multiplexed error-robust fluorescence *in situ* hybridization (FISH), as originally proposed by @Moffitt2016-MERFISH.
Briefly, targets are preassigned a barcode of (multi-color) 'on' and (no-color) 'off' bits, whereas barcodes are optimized to differ from each other by some bits as to minimize readout errors.
After iterative imaging-bleaching, individual reporter binding events are identified computationally (spot calling).
Aligning spots along the image z-stack then allows to identify individual targets based on a predefined barcoding scheme.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.lab="test", fig.cap="**Schematic of barcoded FISH** RNA targets are preassigned a sequence (= barcode) of 'on' and 'off' rounds. In each imaging round, a subset of targets is bound by a complementary probe, which is linked to a fluorescent reporter. After multiple rounds of imaging and stripping, images are decoded computationally to call targets. [*source: https://moffittlab.github.io*]"}

1,000-plex CosMx, for example, employs 64-bit barcodes (4 immunofluorescent reports over 16 cycles of imaging-bleaching) with a Hamming weight and distance of 4 (i.e., every target is 'on' in 4 rounds and 'off' in 12 rounds; each barcode differs from all others by 4 bits as to minimize RNA decoding errors).
Combinatorially, a 64-bit barcoding scheme is sufficient to encode a much larger number of targets, namely, ~20,000 protein-coding genes.

Commercially available panels can typically include three types of barcodes:

- **RNA targets** determine the 'plexity' of the panel.
- **Negative probes** serve to quantify non-specific binding.
- **System controls** serve to quantify spot calling errors.

::: {.callout-note title="non-RNA targets" collapse="true"}
Modeled after synthetic sequences from the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC), **negative probes** contain hybridization regions that are not complementary to the genome or transcriptome of the organism under study; their detection thus corresponds to non-specific ISH probe hybridization events (e.g., in 'sticky' regions of the tissue). 

Depending on the barcoding scheme (number of bits, Hamming weight/distance), a number of barcodes will be left unoccupied; these **system controls** (also referred to as blank or false codes) serve to quantify misidentification of reporter readout.

## Platforms

### Xenium (10x Genomics)

Xenium employ rolling circle amplification (RCA) to boost fluorescent signals from reporter-binding events, thereby improving overall spot calling sensitivity.

Early [panels](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/xenium-panels) were low-plex (100s of targets) while allowing for flexible (and relatively affordable) customization; more recently, a 5,000-plex panel has become available.

### CosMx (NanoString)

Unlike Xenium, CosMx [@He2022-CosMx] does not rely on RCA.
As a result, CosMx tends to be less sensitive than Xenium (albeit higher-plex at present).

Furthermore, segmentation is performed separately for each FOV (without stitching).
This results in a variety of technical artefacts, such as fractured and possibly duplicated cells near FOV borders.

The platform currently supports universal 1,000- and 6,000-plex [panels](https://nanostring.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/cosmx-rna-assays), as well as 1,000-plex panels tailored to human immuno-oncology and mouse neuronal tissue; a whole-transcriptome (~18,000-plex) panel is underway.
