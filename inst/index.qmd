This is the website for the online book **Principles of Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis with Bioconductor**.

This book provides interactive examples and discussion on key principles of computational analysis workflows for spatial transcriptomics data using [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) in R. The book contains chapters describing individual analysis steps as well as extended workflows, each with examples including R code and datasets.

The book is organized into several parts, consisting of introductory materials, and analysis steps and workflows for sequencing-based and imaging-based spatial transcriptomics platforms.

Additional materials on analysis workflows for non-spatial single-cell data, as well as further introductory materials on R and Bioconductor, can be found in the related book [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor (OSCA)](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/).
