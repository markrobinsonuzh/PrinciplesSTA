This is the website for the online book **"Orchestrating Spatially-Resolved Transcriptomics Analysis with Bioconductor" (OSTA)**.

This book provides several examples of computational analysis workflows for **spatially resolved-transcriptomics (SRT)** data, using the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) framework within the R programming language. The chapters contain details on individual analysis steps as well as complete workflows, with example datasets and R code that can be run on your own laptop.

The book is organized into several parts, including background, preprocessing steps, analysis steps, and complete workflows.

Additional introductory material on R and Bioconductor can also be found in the related book [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor (OSCA)](https://osca.bioconductor.org/).
